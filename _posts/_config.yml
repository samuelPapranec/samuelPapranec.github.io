#Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are epected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll´s data files 
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{sitetitle}}, {{site.email}}, and so on
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{site.myvariable}}.
